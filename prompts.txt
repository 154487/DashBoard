Create a dark-themed, interactive personal finance dashboard with an intuitive, modern layout. The design should balance simplicity and analytics: show high-level info at first glance and allow the user to dive into detailed data upon interaction. ### Base Structure: 1. **Title**: "PERSONAL FINANCE OVERVIEW" 2. **Four summary cards**:    - Current Balance    - Total Expenses    - Total Income    - Savings Rate    Include icons, trend percentages, and color indicators for each card. 3. **Charts Section**:    - **Line Chart**: Monthly Balance Trend (Income vs Expenses)      - Keep the interaction basic: tooltip on hover, smooth animation      - Use soft colors: green for income, red for expenses    - **Donut Chart**: Expense Distribution by Category      - Keep this chart interactive but simple: when a user hovers or clicks a slice (e.g., “Food”), show tooltips with amount and percentage      - Do not open modals or expand sections — stay lightweight    - **Second Donut Chart (basic interactive)**: Investment Portfolio Allocation      - Show category distribution for the investment portfolio      - Example labels: “Stocks”, “Crypto”, “Real Estate”, “FIIs”, “Cash”      - Interaction limited to tooltips on hover (no panel/modal)      - Chart should match the theme and style of the first donut chart 4. **Transaction List Section**:    - Show the 5 most recent transactions (type, description, date, amount)    - Allow each transaction to expand slightly on click to show category, account, notes, or tags 5. **Detailed View Modal**:    - When clicking “View All” or any card/metric, show a modal with:      - Filters by date range, category, and account      - Detailed transaction table with sorting options      - Export button (PDF/CSV) 6. **Visual & UX Guidelines**:    - Green = positive / income    - Red = negative / expense    - Blue = neutral / info    - Use dark background (charcoal or deep navy) with soft shadows and rounded elements    - TailwindCSS + Chart.js + FontAwesome    - Ensure layout is fully responsive and smooth on both desktop and mobile ### 🪙 Investment Portfolio Section: 7. **Portfolio Analytics Area**:    - New section titled “Investment Portfolio”    - Display each asset/cota as a card with:      - Name/ticker      - Amount bought/sold      - Current % gain/loss      - Total value change (R$)    - Use a bar or horizontal line per asset showing a "Buy vs Sell" indicator:      - Left icon: Bull 🐂 (Buy)      - Right icon: Bear 🐻 (Sell)      - Position of marker shows tendency (e.g. closer to bear = better to sell now)    - Clicking a cota opens a modal with:      - Price history (line chart)      - Performance timeline      - Notes and recommendation logs ### Visual & UX Guidelines: - Color System:    - Green for income or gains    - Red for expenses or losses    - Blue for info - Background: Deep navy or charcoal - Use TailwindCSS, Chart.js, and FontAwesome - Smooth transitions and mobile responsiveness.
